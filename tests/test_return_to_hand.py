"""
A minion returned to the hand or shuffled into the deck is its card again.

Wiki (Return to hand): a minion returned to its owner's hand is reset to its
card: it loses its enchantments, its damage and its silence, and played again
it is a new minion, with summoning sickness unless it has Charge or Rush.
The same goes for a minion shuffled into a deck, and for one that comes back
from the graveyard (Anub'arak, Malorne).
